### Python
- constructor:
  - A class can be thought of as a blueprint for how to create an object. (1)
  - When an object (aka: instance) is created, the "constructor" method is called to initialize the instance.

- decorator:
  - Simply, wraps a function to do something before, or after, the original function call.
  - Replaces the function reference so that when the function name is called, the wrapper is what actually gets called.
